Lorem Ipsum is a text used as an example filler in the printing industry. It was first used in the 15th century by an unknown printer to fill in a text of a test book. Five centuries later, the electronics industry began to be used, remaining virtually unchanged. Popularized in the 1960s with the publication of Letrasetu sheets, containing fragments of Lorem Ipsum, and more recently with the different versions of Lorem Ipsum containing software designed to implement prints on personal computers, such as Aldus PageMaker
